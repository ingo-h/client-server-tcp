# Client and Server program for TCP connections
This C++ project is mainly used for testing. It provides a multi-platform server object that can run in a thread. Tested platforms are Linux, MacOS and Microsoft Windows. The client object can connect to it on localhost. So it is possible to test the real TCP dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) with one program. There is no need to run a separate server.
